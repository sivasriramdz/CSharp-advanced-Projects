# 🚀 C# Task-Based Programs – Internship at Prodigy Technovations

This repository includes C# programs written on Day 3 of my internship.  
These tasks are based on real-world scenarios and showcase my learning in file handling, collections, LINQ, async programming, and performance comparison.

## 📁 Programs

| File Name                | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `TextToFile.cs`          | Takes multiple lines of input from the user (until they type `"STOP"`), writes to a file `output.txt`, then reads and displays the contents. Implements exception handling. |
| `LinqNumbers.cs`         | Accepts a list of integers and uses LINQ to: <br> a) Find numbers > 50 <br> b) Sort them <br> c) Find the square of each number. |
| `StudentRecords.cs`      | Stores student records using a Dictionary with ID (int) and Name (string). Allows adding, removing, and displaying student data. |
| `AsyncOrder.cs`          | Simulates an order processing system using async/await. Waits 3 seconds before confirming order readiness. |
| `FileWriter/`            | Contains two versions: <br> a) **Single-threaded** – creates 100 files with 10MB of binary data <br> b) **Async/await (parallel)** – creates 100 files concurrently for performance testing. Outputs time comparison. |
